FOLDER ARCHITECTURE

--- OUTPUT OF PROGRAMS ---

attendance from logs table : the attendance table inferred from logs automatically can be found here, use it to inspect the output of generateAttendanceFromLogs.py.

tables : pipeline.py generates new tables here

plots : pipeline.py generates new plots here


--- ALREADY GENERATED PLOTS AND TABLES ---

Those folders serve to manually order the obtained data avaialable in the tables and plots folders.

manually tracked : attendance was manually recorded

moodle tracked : attendance was regularly recorded via moodle

logs inference : no attendance was reliably tracked, we use moodle logs to infer on it

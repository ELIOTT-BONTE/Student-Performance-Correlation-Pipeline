Thanks for using this tool developed in the context of a Master Thesis, hopefully you will find it easy to use

Simply click the "Upload" button and select :
1 "Grades" file, this is the file where your students grades are recorded, make sure the name of the file includes "grade"
1 "Schedule" file, this is the file that defines when courses take place, make sure the name of the file includes "schedule"
Any number of log files (automatically generated by Moodle), make sure they begin with log- followed by the name of the course
Any number of manual attendance recording files, make sure they are named after the course
This file, renamed as "config.txt"

Indeed, you have to use this file to define how you want to analyze the data, so please write the following infos :

FOR LOGS : 
The name of the course (found in the grades file you use),
the abbreviation associated with it (found in the schedules file), 
the kind of session you want to analyze (lecture, practical or tutoring) (check the schedule file for the existence of such sessions).

FOR MANUAL ATTENDANCE FILES :
The name of the course (found in the grades file you use),
the kind of session you want to analyze (lecture, practical or tutoring) (check the schedule file for the existence of such sessions).

FOR VACATION :
Any period of time where the courses where not held and should be excluded from analysis.


EXAMPLE :

LOG FILES

Linear Algebra 1, LA1
Web Development 2, webdev2, lecture
Programming Fundamentals 1, PF1                         if you omit the course type, we default to "lecture"
Programming Fundamentals 3, pf3, lecture
Programming Fundamentals 3, pf3, practical

MANUAL ATTENDANCE FILES

Security 1, practical

Input any vacation or period of time where the course was not held here :


vacation_periods: [('24/12/2023', '26/12/2023'), ('31/12/2023', '01/01/2024')]



Example of upload that would be coherent with the previous lines :
config.txt
course_schedules-ws-2023.all.csv
Grades_2023-2024-ws.xlsx
log-Programming Fundamentals 3.csv
log-Web Development 2.csv
Security 1.xlsx

PS : You can leave all the tutorial lines, the program will ignore them, just add your own after this line !
